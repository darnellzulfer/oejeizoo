                            <p> i have googled and googled, and in the past was able to re register the client print driver dll files however after recent patches this is no longer working and users are calling all day stating they cant print and we have to login and give the report viewer our admin credentials and everything goes back to normal. This is one article (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mariae/archive/2010/04/13/error-unable-to-load-client-print-control-when-printing-reports-in-reporting-services-summary-of-all-possible-. Very noob question here, I do apologize in advance. I'm looking to get my hands dirty with windows server 2012 r2 and wanted to install the trial version. I get to this point after selecting ISO (as opposed to hyper-v, azure, vhd, etc) and i'm not sure what to with these files. Do I just copy them all to a dvd/usb? Extract them first then transfer to dvd/usb? Disregard all except the last one? Thanks for any help. Files that I am looking at: http://imgur.com/QCdjYxa. Hello, I need some helping to solve this issue I'm stuck with at work. We have an Web API in NET Framework 4.7.1 (It has an API, Application, Core, Test projects). The project is complex and it has code from 10+ different developers. We use Microsoft Dynamics D365 8.2 OnPremise for our data, so anytime we have to do CRUD operations we have to connect with the CRM via their SDK code. The project is hosted on IIS 8.5 Windwos Server 2012 R2 and the front-end is Angular 5 (we use the withCredential. Hello, I have 2x Windows 2012 R2 AD servers (redundant setup). I basically followed this guide (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftrservertigerteam/2017/04/10/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-ldaps-on-windows-server/) to setup LDAPS and create the cert/CA. From what I can tell it appears to work on the Win 7 clients on my domain as the AD servers are already trusted CA's to them. I have a CentOS 7 server running Apache Guacamole. I can manually copy the exported Hi everyone! Today's (slightly) belated post is around KMS Activation for Windows Server 2019. Yes, I know that its not available to download on MSDN, Visual Studio, or VLSC, but you can be ready to go when you can grab it again.

I’m Graeme Bray (https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/graeme%20bray%20%5Bmsft%5D/) I have an 8-server ADFS 3.0 farm that I inherited from a coworker who is no longer with the company. All servers are running ADFS 3 on Windows Server 2012, with databases on SQL Server 2012. 7 of the 8 servers are functioning as desired, but I found the ADFS service stopped on one machine yesterday and when I try to restart the service I get an error popup showing Error 1064: "An exception occurred in the service when handling the control request." amp#x200B; When this happens 
I understand in a general sense that LDAPS (Encrypted LDAPS) is LDAP with SSL encryption. I have read numerous articles on how to set it up. What I am unclear on is how clients are configured to use LDAPS? I have Server 2012 R2 server(s) as my AD/LDAP servers and Windows 7 Pro client machines. Once I generate the certificate needed and follow the steps to set things up server side, do I need to push the cert out to client machines in some fashion (GPO etc.)? Do I need to configure clients. I followed the directions from this post (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoftrservertigerteam/2017/04/10/step-by-step-guide-to-setup-ldaps-on-windows-server/) on msdn a little while back. I generated the cert required and am using ldp.exe on a client machine to check that it works and am unsure of the results. Background I have 2x AD/DC servers (redundant server) running Server 2012 R2. My client machines are mostly Windows 7 Pro x64. Lets call the servers: ad-01.domain.com. Getting real tired of the question, "can you setup such and such RemoteApp on this computer for me?" We have Windows 10 build 16299 and Windows Server 2012 R2 in our environment. Using the following information, I tried it out but have not seen much in the way of success. Obviously the script is intended for Windows 7 but wanted to test it out anyway since it only says Windows 10 is "unverified". https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/313a95b3-a698-4bb0-9ed6-d89a47eacc72#content.

Good evening, or morning, or whatever time it may be wherever you are in the world. Today (tonight's) article is a Quick Reference post for debugging Windows and Virtual Machines in a post-mortem situation. I get a ton of questions about what my Crash Dumps should be set to, so hopefully this article helps clear up some of this! Without further ado.

I have a lot of old keys from a MSDN subscription I had back in 2014. These include pretty much all microsoft products, including Windows Server 2012 R2 (which I'm running at home right now). A cool side effect of having a bunch of extra Windows 7/8/8.1 keys is that I can now use them for brand new Windows 10 installations. I was hoping the Server 2012 keys would operate the same way but it seems like that's a no. To that end, does anyone know if there's some other way to use these Hey All, I have a Windows Server 2012 R2, which is running a standalone instance of AD LDS.

Hi all, after a lot of digging and help from topics on WD forums I feel like I need to do a tiny (I was expecting this to be shorter, TL;DR at the bottom) writeup on how I managed to get a Arch Linux to run on the Sentinel DX4000 I got second hand with no (compatible) disks. (device is normally restricted to a whitelist of (no longer available) disks and a USB installer for Windows Server stuff) Failures: Always good to see the method to my madness.
