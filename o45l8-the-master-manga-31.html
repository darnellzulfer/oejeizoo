Nino’s character development, Keima’s strategy in TWGOK and ITSUKI END GAME’s possibilities Harem, while a common genre in manga/anime, is SUPER hard to handle correctly.

So, I wanted to do a second part of my analysis on possible other endings yesterday that stray away from the two sisters, but after I re-read the manga for hours straight, I decided to hold off on that as I now have a fresh memory of events and new perspectives to both characters. I'm going to be dissecting these two and their relationship to Natsuo and how it potentially could end up with one of these two being with Natsuo at the conclusion of DG. Grab your popcorn, this is going to be anoth.

MANGA __________ Title Volumes Price Notes --- --- --- --- Air Gear 1  Alabaster I thought I would share a little list. Two rules to make the list. Is it (A) a close combat fighting manga without much use of weapons and/or superpowers? Is it (B) longer than 6 volumes long? I’ve tried to include as many manga as possible. But I have run into confusion with manga like Ranma ½ and Kinnikuman. Is there enough fighting? Is there too much comedy? Feel free to point out any silly mistakes, such as mislabelling genres. I’ve also included anime series for fun. 1 Fully. I wrote this on r/Naruto and decided to post it here as well. With Chapter 31 that came out, I think it's appropriate time to see your opinion on this topic. My biggest problem was and always will be that Boruto is set in same era in which Naruto lives. I harms both new and old characters and in my opinion it ruins sacrifices that Jiraya, Nagato, Yahiko and Konan went through and legacy that Naruto build through them. Let me explain: We all know that Naruto is a God. Having vast arsenal Hello fellow Keions! I'm still dreaming about drawing my own K-ON! Manga strip some day (a cute YuiAzu reunion story after the college arc of course!). Although I improved my drawing skills in the past two years I'm still  well  a little bit noobish when it comes to drawing people and backgrounds in anime style. I want to imitate the typical KyoAni drawing style, but I don't really know what it is making it so special and cute. I know, there are some "moe blob" archtypes like very small.

Does anyone have any information on this series I read it on manga master but just to chapter 31. I have no idea if there's more or what I can't find information anywhere.
