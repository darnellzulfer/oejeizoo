                            <p> All games on haves and wants Gidday Im looking for a game that brings a sense of an adventure story in a bright cheerful setting, something like Uncharted (I’ve payed through the whole series). I’ve just finished several months of playing in distopian settings (fallout, Horizon Zero Dawn, Dues Ex) and need a break from this style of game. Any recommendations? Is Black Flag a pirate adventure with some humor and some just plain fun? EDIT: Thanks everyone - sounds like black flag is a great match for what I’m looking. I realize that both of these are loosely based on history, but the amount and frequency of these similarities is uncanny. Both stories share many of the same characters, and at times, it feels the plots are one and the same, from the conflict with Britain, to the Urca de Lima. It's also worth noting that these two titles were released only a few months apart. I'm wondering if Starz and Ubisoft had any coordination or plan to increase sales, or maybe one company copied the other. I just got a 900MB update for AC4, did anyone else get this, and if you did are their patch noted 
The season pass for Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag is on sale right now, but it's cheaper to buy the One version. There was a promo where if you buy the 360 version, you get the One pass for free and apparently the promo is still up. I just wanted to know if someone bought My brother decided to dust off the PS3 and turn on AC 4. In the first cut scene, there's the assassin on the other ship. In regards to this assassin, was it ever learned why this assassin was there in the first place or why they engaged in a fight. Is this game still active in the multiplayer aspect? It is on sale on ps4 and I am debating on getting. I resently decided to go for the platinum on AC4, but can not find a match for Domination or Wanted gamemode. Does anyone know if you can get the All Rounder trophy from private matches. A good one. There are some things that annoy me (regenerating health stupidity over having health potions like in the ezio trilogy) but I weirdly enjoy sailing when in 3 I hated it at the beginning. Also, the game's color palette is gorgeous. When I was in Havana I totally got vice city vibes. The sparkly crystal clear blue ocean. it's beautiful I know everyone is busy getting really hyped over assassin's creed unity and rogue (as am I), but I would like to ask a question. I am playing black flag again, and I had an idea: I jumped off the jackdaw, swam over to another ship, climbed up, and killed everyone on it. However, I didn't get to take the ship or anything (it was really disappointing). Do you think they would change that in Rogue, or am I wrong in assuming that any pirate-like content would even exist WANT LIST: Kinect for Xbox One Offers for Xbox One Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D (3DS) ___________________________________________________________ HERE ARE MY GAMES!

So i haven't played assassin's creed since brotherhood, and I wanted to get into AC again before Unity. And i'm simply wondering which of the 3 games named in the title you think is worth buying the most. I played AC2 and AC Brotherhood and really enjoyed them. EDIT: So i've decided to get ACR since a lot of you guys recommended it and it's nice to play the story in order.
